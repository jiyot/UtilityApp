Welcome to the Monthly Electricity Bill Calculator app! This React Native application is designed to help users estimate the cost of their monthly electricity bill based on usage and regulatory charges.

## Project Details

### Academic Integrity
This project focuses on React Native and JavaScript skills. It evaluates programming proficiency, UI design capabilities, selection of suitable data structures, and problem-solving abilities.

## Task Description

### Build a Single Screen Application

Created a single-screen application enabling users to calculate their monthly electricity bill. The total bill amount is computed as the sum of electricity usage charges and regulatory charges.

### UI Design

1. **Initial UI:**
   - Three text boxes for entering morning, afternoon, and evening electricity usage.
   - A switch to indicate the use of a renewable energy source.
   - Two buttons: Calculate and Reset.

2. **Textbox Features:**
   - Proper hints for textboxes.
   - Appropriate keyboard types for efficient input.

3. **Calculate Button:**
   - Calculates and displays the bill breakdown.
   - Executes only if all textboxes are filled; otherwise, it shows an error message.

4. **Reset Button:**
   - Clears all textboxes, switches, and displayed calculations.

5. **Styling:**
   - Customize colours and font size while ensuring a readable and organized UI.

### Calculation of Monthly Bill

The monthly electricity bill is calculated based on usage charges and regulatory charges. The app considers rates for morning, afternoon, and evening electricity usage. Regulatory charges include sales tax and an environmental rebate for renewable energy use.

## Implementation 

- Code is in JavaScript.
- Utilized the `Pressable` element for styled buttons.
- Used function-based components.
- Aligned `Switch` elements properly on Android using Flexbox.2. Use function-based components.
- Declared variables using `let` and `const`
- Defined functions using arrow function syntax.
- Using a `ScrollView` if the UI contents are too tall for the screen.
- Conditionally showed or hidden elements using inline if statements.
- Utilized JavaScript, function-based components, and arrow function syntax.
